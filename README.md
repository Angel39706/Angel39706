  Limit - Utilized SwiftUI and UIKit, I demonstrated my UI skills while introducing innovative features, implemented a productivity timer, and a dynamic TO-DO scheduler with local notifications via the UserNotifications framework. The integration of Firebase enriched the app's capabilities, and my commitment to the MVVM architecture ensured a maintainable codebase.

  Angels Split - Leveraging SwiftUI, I designed a sleek user interface that harmonizes aesthetics and user-friendliness. The app's foundation lies in a custom REST API detailing my workout routine, fetched via a network manager for dynamic JSON data integration. A standout feature involves using User Defaults to track personal lifting records, enhancing user engagement. This project epitomizes my skills in UI design, API connectivity, and creative data management to craft impactful iOS experiences.
